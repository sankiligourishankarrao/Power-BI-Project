# Power-BI-Project

In this project, 
I built a multi-page HR analytics dashboard in Power BI for Inchcape plc, a global leader in premium and luxury automotive distribution and retail with operations across multiple regions and headquarters in London. 
The goal was to support strategic, tactical, and predictive decision making through dynamic dashboards and scorecards focused on employee and business performance.
Using Power BI, I handled data extraction, modeling, and visualization to enable users to dynamically drill into customer and sales data across years, products, and regions, supporting better decision making and resource allocation. 
The project followed Agile methodology with sprint-based development, where I iteratively refined requirements and visualizations with stakeholders. 
I designed a bookmark-driven, multi-page dashboard where clicking specific images navigates to the relevant report view, and users can interact with customer and date filters to view tailored insights. 
A dedicated back button allows users to easily return to the home page, providing a smooth and intuitive navigation experience.
